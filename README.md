File Storage App is an openâ€‘source file storage platform. It allows you to upload files for storage, share or download them, delete them, and set access permissions.

This application's tech stack is Node.js & Express for the back-end, Handlebars.js for the front-end, and MongoDB for the database.

# Installation

Follow these simple instructions to set up File Storage App locally.
1. Clone the repository and install its dependencies.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/JoshuaAGK/File-Storage-App.git
    cd File-Storage-App
    npm i
    ```

2. Run the build script, which builds the TypeScript from `/src` into `/dist`, and copies over all non-TypeScript files (Handlebars, images, etc).
    ```
    npm run build
    ```

3. Create an environment file `.env` in the root folder. Add your MongoDB details to it:
    ```
    MONGODB_USERNAME=<Your username>
    MONGODB_PASSWORD=<Your password>
    MONGODB_BASE_URL=<Your database's base URL>
    MONGODB_OPTIONS=<Any database options>
    ```

4. Create a secret string in `.env`. This will be used to sign and verify JWTs.
    ```
    TOKEN_SECRET=<Your secret string>
    ```

5. Run the application from `/dist`.
    ```
    nodemon /dist/app.js
    ```
